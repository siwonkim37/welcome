  <p><strong>Motion graphic <u>design</u></strong> is a subset of graphic design  
     in that it uses graphic design principles in a filmmaking or video production context
     (or other temporally evolving visual media) <br>through the use of animation or filmic techniques.
     Examples include the kinetic typography<br>
     and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, 
     three-dimensional station identification logos of some television channels.
     The art form has been around for decades, <br>and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.</p>

  <p>A motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has 
     learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge,
     <br>though motion designers can also come from filmmaking or animation backgrounds, <br>and may use tools
     or training from those fields as well.<br>[1]
     Motion graphic design is often used in the film industry. <br>Openings to movies, television shows,
     and news programs can use photography, typography,
     and motion graphics to make the introduction Motion graphic design has also achieved widespread 
    <br>use in content marketing and advertising.
     With global technology firm Cisco projecting that 82 percent of all web traffic will be video by 2022[2],
    <br>marketers and advertisers have focused much of their efforts on the production of high-quality
     branded video and motion graphic content.</p></div>
